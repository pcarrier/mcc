Description
-----------

A simple memcached CLI tool. Reasonably designed to grow into a toolkit if anybody wants to spend time on it (very few efforts went into this).

Features
--------

- dump: Dump all key+value pairs available in `stats cachedump` in a binary file.
- TODO: Restore the key+value pairs into any set of servers (with support for xmemcached sharding).

On a standard `memcached`, the response to this command is limited to 2MB.
However the implementation is quite optimized and should be able to scale to much larger responses.
